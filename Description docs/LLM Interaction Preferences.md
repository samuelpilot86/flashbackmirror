# LLM Interaction Preferences - Flashback Project

## User Preferences & Communication Style

### File Creation & Modification Rules
- **Strict compliance**: Follow user instructions exactly and narrowly
- **No additions**: Do not add extra content, sections, or features unless explicitly requested
- **No unsolicited code modification**: If I explicitly ask you to do something, you can change the code, but if I ask a question, answer the question without changing the code (you can explain what you would change but do not change it)

Do not ask me to run commands such as cd "/Users/samuel/kDrive/Docs légers - DD/PM IA/MVP/Flashback/app" && python3 -m http.server 8000
In the case you think it should be done, proceed without doing it.These commands do not help. Skip asking this i
