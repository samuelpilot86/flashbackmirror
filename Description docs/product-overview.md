Flashback Mirror is a web app that continuously records from the camera and the microphone of the device. It allows the user to review the recording in a very quick and user-friendly way.

It can be used by scenic artists, athletes and public speakers to train themselves by reviewing their performance, in a more convenient way than current phone apps allow.
